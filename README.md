## Kind of database

This is a well-organized filing system for digital information. It's designed to store data in a structured way.
Data is organized into tables, where each table represents a specific category of information.
These tables are connected through relationships, much like how different pieces of information are linked in real life. 
The relational database uses a language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data. 
SQL allows you to perform various operations on the data, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting records. 
It ensures data integrity and consistency by enforcing rules that govern how data is stored and related.
