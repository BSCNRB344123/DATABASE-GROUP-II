## Project Description

This is a Database System I project assignment for the course BSC 2107: Database System I at St. Paul's University. The aim of this project is to develop a tool that can store data in a structured way.

## Project objective

This database's main goal is to streamline data integration and enhance the efficient management of diverse businesses in a conglomerate that operates across East Africa.
The company encounters issues because its different businesses have separate IT infrastructures, hindering efforts to achieve a comprehensive customer perspective and implement a loyalty program that spans the entire conglomerate. 
The database is designed to tackle these hurdles and provide a solution for centralized data management.

## Kind of database

This is a well-organized filing system for digital information. It's designed to store data in a structured way.
Data is organized into tables, where each table represents a specific category of information.
These tables are connected through relationships, much like how different pieces of information are linked in real life. 
The relational database uses a language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data. 
SQL allows you to perform various operations on the data, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting records. 
It ensures data integrity and consistency by enforcing rules that govern how data is stored and related.
